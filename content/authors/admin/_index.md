I am Hsuan-Ling Lin, I am currently an SDE intern at Amazon. I am responsible for designing and implementing a Risk Aggregator API using Java for preventing fraud in fraud mitigation toolkit.
Also, I created a plugin by AWS Lambda and API Gateway for invoking an internal back-end service and aggregated the
results for upstream client.
I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Rice University. 
I am proficient in Python and Java and have experience in designing web applications using Java Spring and Django. 
I was a backend developer at JKOPay, which is the most widely used mobile payment system in Taiwan. 
I was in charge of developing RESTful APIs and backend services. 
In particular, I managed a project in building an e-ticking system using Spring Boot and MySQL. 
My current GPA is 4.0. My relevant coursework includes Database System Implementation and Web development and Design since I want to solidify my knowledge in databases, and I am curious about how frontend works. 
My career interest is to design services to help people’s lives easier and satisfy their needs.
