I am Hsuan-Ling Lin, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Rice University.
My current GPA is 4.0 and relevant coursework includes Database System Implementation and Web development and Design since I want to solidify my knowledge in databases, and I am curious about how frontend works. 

I was an SDE intern at Amazon that responsible for designing and implementing an API using Java to aggregate data to client. I am familiar with the AWS ecosystem.
My technical capabilities are Python and Java and I have experience in designing web applications using Java Spring and Django.
My career interest is to design services to help people’s lives easier and satisfy their needs.
